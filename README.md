# ios-mount

Since I don't use any iOS device anymore, I decided to move these scripts from [Glorious-Dotfiles](https://github.com/neo64yt/glorious-dotfiles) to this repository for archival reasons. 

This repository contains two scripts:

* ios-mount

A simple shell wrapper for [ifuse](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/ifuse). I created this script because I was too lazy to type long commands just to mount (and eject) my iPhone's filesystem.

* imountmgr

A very simplistic dmenu frontend for ios-mount with only two options: mount or eject.
